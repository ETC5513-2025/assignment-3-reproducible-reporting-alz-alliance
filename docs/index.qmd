### Problem introduction

<br></br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">**More than 2/3 of startups failed** to generate positive returns to investors (Eisenmann, 2021).^[Eisenmann, T. (2021). Why Start-ups Fail. Harvard Business Review. Retrieved May 27, 2025, from https://hbr.org/2021/05/why-start-ups-fail

*Why and when do startups fail, and how do factors like industry and funding levels influence these outcomes?*

### Dataset description
- Source: CB Insights’ public database of 483 startup post-mortems
- Data covers:
  - Startup name, sector, country
  - Funding raised
  - Duration of operation
  - Self-reported reasons for failure (multi-label)
---

### Methods


::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%;">
<img src="images/method.jpg" style="width:100%;" />
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

**Data cleaning**

- Data type conversion, including amount of fundings, and years of operations
- Categorize startups based on their funding amount - Low-funded (<$20M); Medium-funded ($20M - $70M); High-funded (>$70M)

**Data analysis**

- Analysis on failure reason by sector, funding groups 
- Temporal analysis on years and duration of operations

**Top universal reasons** for failure:

  - Competition (70%)
  - Poor market fit, acquisition stagnation, budget constraints

But nuances emerge across sectors and funding groups...

### Conclusions and recommendations {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Competition drives failures (70% of startups).
-	**Sector-specific:** High costs in Food Services (52%), budget issues in Manufacturing (55%), poor market fit in Healthcare (40%).
-	**Funding levels:** Low-funded face market fit issues (26%); high-funded struggle with execution flaws (23%).
- Startup formations peaked at 62 in 2012 lead to active startups peaked at 326 in 2015. Startup closures spiked to 64 in 2020 due to COVID-19.
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="37%"}
::: {.callout-tip title="Recommendation"}

- **Founders**: Develop flexible strategies to handle market shifts (lesson learnt from post-2015 saturation).
- **Investors/Incubators**: Provide mentorship, market access, and operational guidance.
- Anticipate policy changes from the 2025 U.S. administration, such as potential tariff increases on tech components or stricter data privacy laws, and adjust strategies to capitalize on these shifts by adopting local sourcing or developing privacy-focused solutions.
