**Top universal reasons** for failure:

- **Medium-funded ($20M–$70M)**: Acquisition stagnation (25%), monetization (21%), execution flaws (16%) - challenges in revenue generation and executions
- **High-funded (>$70M)**: Execution flaws (23%), stagnation (23%), trend shifts (16%) - challenges in adaptation to market shifts and executions
