## Problem introduction

<br></br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">**More than 2/3 of startups failed** to generate positive returns to investors</div>  


*Why and when do startups fail, and how do factors like industry and funding levels influence these outcomes?*

## Dataset description
- Source: CB Insights’ public database of 483 startup post-mortems
- Data covers:
  - Startup name, sector, country
  - Funding raised
  - Duration of operation
  - Self-reported reasons for failure (multi-label)
- Analyses include failure reason by sector, funding groups and temporal analysis

## Results 

![sector](images/overall-reason.png)

**Top universal reasons** for failure:
  - Competition (70%)
  - Poor market fit, acquisition stagnation, budget constraints

But nuances emerge across sectors and funding groups...

---

### Startups in different sector failed differently, for example ...

![sector](images/sector-reason.png)

- **Accommodation & Food**: 52% cite high operational costs
- **Healthcare & Manufacturing**: Over 50% cite budget/resource shortages
- **Retail Trade**: Diverse causes – niche limits, poor market fit, execution flaws
- **Finance & Tech**: Competition dominates, fewer financial challenges lowering barrier to entry

---

### Startups in different funding groups failed differently

![funding](images/funding-reason.png)

- **Low-funded (<$20M)**: Niche limits (29%), market fit issues (26%), budget (21%) - challenges in market validation
- **Medium-funded ($20M–$70M)**: Acquisition stagnation (25%), monetization (21%), execution flaws (16%) - challenges in revenue generation and executions
- **High-funded (>$70M)**: Execution flaws (23%), stagnation (23%), trend shifts (16%) - challenges in adaptation to market shifts and executions

---

### External factors also play a role in the failure of startups

## Conclusions and/or recommendations

- Competition drives failures (70% of startups).
-	Sector-specific: High costs in Food Services (52%), budget issues in Manufacturing (55%), poor market fit in Healthcare (40%).
-	Funding levels: Low-funded face market fit issues (26%); high-funded struggle with execution flaws (23%).
- Startup formations peaked at 62 in 2012 lead to active startups peaked at 326 in 2015. Startup closures spiked to 64 in 2020 due to COVID-19.
::: {.callout-tip title="Recommendation"}

- Founders: Develop flexible strategies to handle market shifts (lesson learnt from post-2015 saturation).
- Investors/Incubators: Provide mentorship, market access, and operational guidance.
- Anticipate policy changes from the 2025 U.S. administration, such as potential tariff increases on tech components or stricter data privacy laws, and adjust strategies to capitalize on these shifts by adopting local sourcing or developing privacy-focused solutions.
